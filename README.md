- 👋 Hi there, I'm Sheena (sheenz09)
- 👀 I’m interested in learning **mobile security**, **web development**, and **app behavior research**. I love diving into how apps work under the hood, analyzing traffic, and building tools that help make tech more transparent and secure.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **mobile security**
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Security research projects, web development tools, and Android app analysis. I'm especially interested in open source contributions related to digital privacy, ethical hacking, and secure application design.

- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I joined tech for the security… stayed for the memes and late-night code marathons.
